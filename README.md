## UI Toolkit Autofit 
Utility for the `UnityEngine.UIElements` package that allows Text Elements to be resized based on a screen percent, which is 
not a feature of Unity as of 2023. The components in this package should 
be automatically recognized by UIToolkit. Resizable Label and Button components are provided.

See original issue on the [Unity Forum](https://forum.unity.com/threads/button-text-size-in-doesnt-work.1037551/#post-8865495)
where I first proposed this solution.
